# Codebase Cleanup & Maintainability Plan

## üéØ **Objectives**

This branch focuses on improving code quality, developer experience, and long-term maintainability
of the Omni MCP project.

## üìã **Cleanup Tasks**

### **1. Dependency Management** `[Priority: High]`

**Issue:** Knip found 17 unused dependency hints in mcp-admin

```
Unused dependencies detected:
- @radix-ui/react-avatar, @radix-ui/react-dialog, @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
- @radix-ui/react-label, @radix-ui/react-progress, @radix-ui/react-select
- @radix-ui/react-separator, @radix-ui/react-slot, @radix-ui/react-switch
- @radix-ui/react-tabs, class-variance-authority, clsx, lucide-react
- next-themes, sonner, tailwind-merge, zod
```

**Actions:**

- [ ] Audit actual usage vs. declared dependencies
- [ ] Remove truly unused packages
- [ ] Update knip configuration for legitimate exclusions
- [ ] Optimize bundle size

### **2. Component Architecture** `[Priority: High]`

**Issue:** Large, monolithic components hurt maintainability

**Current Issues:**

- `mcp-testing-view.tsx` (1018 lines) - Too large and complex
- Mixed concerns in single components
- Repeated UI patterns

**Actions:**

- [ ] Break down large components into focused, single-purpose pieces
- [ ] Create reusable compound components for common patterns
- [ ] Implement proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Extract custom hooks for complex logic

### **3. Type Safety** `[Priority: Medium]`

**Issue:** Inconsistent TypeScript usage and type safety

**Actions:**

- [ ] Eliminate remaining `any` types
- [ ] Add proper interface definitions for API responses
- [ ] Implement stricter TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Add discriminated unions for better type narrowing

### **4. Error Handling** `[Priority: Medium]`

**Issue:** Inconsistent error handling patterns across services

**Current State:**

- Some services use try/catch, others don't
- Inconsistent error message formatting
- No centralized error boundary strategy

**Actions:**

- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Implement centralized error boundary components
- [ ] Create consistent error message formatting
- [ ] Add proper error logging and monitoring

### **5. API Layer** `[Priority: Medium]`

**Issue:** Inconsistent API patterns and response handling

**Actions:**

- [ ] Standardize API request/response patterns
- [ ] Implement consistent data fetching hooks
- [ ] Add proper loading and error states
- [ ] Optimize caching strategies

### **6. Testing Strategy** `[Priority: Medium]`

**Issue:** Limited test coverage for core functionality

**Actions:**

- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add component tests for key UI components
- [ ] Add integration tests for critical user flows

### **7. Developer Experience** `[Priority: Low]`

**Issue:** Could improve tooling and development workflow

**Actions:**

- [ ] Enhance development scripts and tooling
- [ ] Improve documentation and code comments
- [ ] Add better TypeScript path mappings
- [ ] Optimize build and development server performance

### **8. Performance Optimization** `[Priority: Low]`

**Issue:** Potential performance improvements

**Actions:**

- [ ] Implement proper code splitting
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and loading
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper memoization where needed

## üèóÔ∏è **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup**

1. Fix dependency issues (unused packages)
2. Standardize error handling patterns
3. Improve TypeScript type safety

### **Phase 2: Component Refactoring**

1. Break down large components
2. Create reusable UI patterns
3. Implement proper separation of concerns

### **Phase 3: Quality & Testing**

1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Implement performance optimizations
3. Enhance developer experience

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on utilities and business logic
- **Component Tests:** Test UI components in isolation
- **Integration Tests:** Test critical user workflows
- **E2E Tests:** Test complete user journeys

## üìä **Success Metrics**

- [ ] Zero unused dependencies
- [ ] All components under 500 lines
- [ ] 80%+ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage for critical paths
- [ ] 50% reduction in bundle size (where possible)
- [ ] Improved developer onboarding time

## üîÑ **Continuous Improvement**

- Regular knip audits for dependency management
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Code review guidelines for maintainability
- Performance monitoring and alerts
