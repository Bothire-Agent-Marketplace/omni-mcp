# Claude Desktop MCP Setup Complete! 🎉

Your Claude Desktop is now configured to work with two powerful MCP servers:

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

  - `search-films` - Search films by title, category, or actor
  - `get-store-inventory` - Check available inventory by store

### 2. Filesystem MCP Server (Official Node.js)

- **Purpose**: Read, write, and manage local files
- **Access**: Limited to `/Users/vince/Projects/omni/data/files` and `/Users/vince/Projects/omni/data/uploads`
- **Available Tools**: File operations (read, write, list, create, move, search)

### 3. PostgreSQL Database

- **Status**: ✅ Running with DVD rental sample data
- **Data**: 5 customers, 5 films, rental history, inventory
- **Access**: Available to database MCP server

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Claude Desktop Config Location

The config includes 3 MCP servers:

1. `MCP_DOCKER` (your existing server)
2. `filesystem` (file operations)
3. `database-toolbox` (DVD rental database)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

**Important**: You must restart Claude Desktop for the new MCP servers to be recognized.

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q)
2. Reopen Claude Desktop
3. The MCP servers will be automatically started when you begin a conversation

### Step 5: Verify Integration

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to **Settings** > **Developer** or look for the **Search and tools** panel
3. You should see the connected MCP servers and available tools
4. Toggle on the tools you want Claude to access

### Step 6: Test the Setup

Try these example prompts in Claude Desktop:

#### Database Queries

- "Show me all customers in the database"
- "What films do we have in our inventory?"
- "Get the rental history for customer ID 1"
- "Search for films with 'action' in the title"

#### File Operations

- "List the files in my projects directory"
- "Read the contents of test.txt"
- "Create a new file called 'notes.txt' with some sample content"
- "Search for files containing 'MCP'"

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### If MCP Servers Don't Appear

1. Check that Docker is running
2. Verify PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml ps`
3. Restart Claude Desktop completely
4. Check Claude Desktop's developer console for errors

### If Database Queries Fail

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker exec mcp-postgres pg_isready -U postgres`
2. Check database has data: `docker exec mcp-postgres psql -U postgres -d dvdrental -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;"`

### If File Operations Fail

1. Verify directories exist: `ls -la /Users/vince/Projects/omni/data/`
2. Check file permissions
3. Ensure Docker can access the mounted volumes

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Filesystem access is restricted to the specified directories only
- Database access is limited to read operations on the DVD rental database
- All MCP servers run in isolated Docker containers
- Only trusted, official MCP server implementations are used

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** (most important!)
2. Test the example prompts above
3. Explore combining database queries with file operations
4. Try asking Claude to create reports based on database data
